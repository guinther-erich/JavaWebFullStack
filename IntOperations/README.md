# IntOperations
First program write with Java of the Formação Java Web Full-Stack (JDev Treinamentos).

# Cautions
- Use parentheses to enclose the variables you want to use in the account, otherwise the operation will only approximate one result to another. For example:
```
int exam1 = 90; 
int exam2 = 70;

System.out.println("The sum is =" + exam1 + exam2); was printed "The sum is 9070"
System.out.println("The sum is =" + (exam1 + exam2)); was printed "The sum is 160"
```
- If you use a calculator to check the result, you will see that the average shown does not match the actual value. This is due to the terms used variables of type int.

# To run
- Eclipse IDE was used to run this code.
